If you think the concept of free speech is often misunderstood, you are absolutely right.

The concept of free speech interpreted differently based on religious, political system and cultural contexts.

## Free-Speech in the USA context

::info
free speech as a legal right is *not originally American*, but the strongest and clearest modern form of it *did* come from the U.S. Constitution.
::

The most impotent documented thing about Free-Speech in USA in First Amendment in American constitution:

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

Let's break it down:

- **Freedom of Religion:** The government can't favor one religion over another.
- **Freedom of Speech:** You can express your thoughts, even if they're unpopular.
- **Freedom of Press:** The media can report news without government control or censorship.
- **Right to Assemble:** People can gather for protests, rallies, or public meetings.
- **Right to Petition the Government:** You can ask for changes from the government without fear of punishment.

In other words, the idea of free speech is that, it is harder for governments to restrict certain forms of communication than it is **for the government** to restrict other forms of physical actions.

in other words, It means **Communication** (like speaking, writing, protesting peacefully) is **more protected** than other kinds of behavior (like stealing, vandalizing, or physical violence).

Governments have **less power** to punish or control speech **than they do** to punish regular actions or conduct.

## How is free speech enforced?

The enforcement of Free-speech is not largely by the government, It is enforcement by the people culture in their everyday lives and how they react to speech that doesn't really aligned with their desires.

so the enforcement of these type of legal norms are depends to a very significant amount of public acceptance. If we want to avoid actions that violate the law in any aspects including violating the Free-Speech then we need a fair amount of education about these subjects.

In other words, relying solely on the formal mechanism of legal systems means we are acting too late.

## So what is this misconception?

psychologists have done lot of [research](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/motivated-reasoning) about something called **motivated reasoning**.

Motivated reasoning is a cognitive bias where people's reasoning and judgment are influenced by their motivations and desires. This means they are more likely to accept information and arguments that align with their existing beliefs and motivations, and they may be less receptive to information that contradicts them.

**Long story short, motivated reasoning is believing the world is the way you want to be.**

And because Free-Speech is such a counter intuitive idea, there a good chance that people will engage in motivated reasoning.

## So what is not included in the context of Free-Speech?

Here are some stories where people bring up free speech as a defense (wrongly).

## Is Free Speech Only Defined in the USA?

## Free-Speech in Iran

**free-speech in Iran is often granted. but it is limited** to protect:

- **Religious sanctity** (e.g., bans on blasphemy),
- **Political authority** (e.g., no criticism of the Supreme Leader),
- **Cultural values** (e.g., modesty, morality codes).

## Wrapping up

There is so much to think and talk about. things like: "What if censorship is needed? Is censorship and violating Free-speech always has bad consequences?
