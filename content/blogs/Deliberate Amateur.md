# When Less of the Same Is More

David Epstein in ["Range"](https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484) examined the world’s most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters and scientists. He discovered that in most fields—especially those that are complex and unpredictable(has a wicked environment)—generalists, not specialists, are primed to excel.

I will try to write some summery of chapter 3rd of this book.

## Ospedale della Pietà

Chapter 3 begins with the story of the _‘Ospedale della Pieta’_ in Baroque Venice (17th/18th c.) which was an orphanage that trained abandoned girls in music. A group of Venetian nuns called the Consorelle di Santa Maria dell'Umiltà established this charitable institution for orphans and abandoned girls in the fourteenth century. By the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Pietà and the three other charitable Ospedali Grandi were well known for its all-female musical ensembles that attracted tourists and patrons from around Europe.

Here, one of them is _‘Figlie di coro’._  it was the all-female music ensemble that were highly acclaimed, popular, and influential in defining an entire musical era. These girls were the seventh-century equivalent of rock stars.

Figlie took singing lessons, and learned to play every instrument their institution owned. it helped that they were paid for learning new skills.

The distinguishing characteristic of this orchestra was the instrumental range of the musicians with each musician being skilled not in one but an assortment of instruments. Famous composers like Antonio Vivaldi taught and wrote music specifically for the figlie.

## Breaking Convention - Case "Django Reinhardt"

[Django Reinhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt) was born in Belgium in 1910. Django went to school if he felt like it, but he mostly didn't. He crashed movie theaters and shot biliards, and was surrounded by music. Django Reinhardt's love for the guitar developed in his early years, influenced by his family and the musical environment around him. Django started with violin but he didn't love it. He learned in the call-and-response style (it means he learned by listening to and imitating other musicians, often playing along with them in informal settings). when he was twelve an acquaintance gave him a [hybrid banjo guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo_guitar). He had found his thing, and became obsessed. In 1928, he suffered severe burns in a fire that left him with limited use of his left hand. Despite this challenge, Reinhardt developed a remarkable technique that allowed him to play chords with a thumb and two fingers.

He is particularly known for his contributions to the genre of gypsy jazz, which blends traditional Romani music with jazz elements. Even though he never learned to read music (or words- he was illiterate), Django composed a symphony, playing on his guitar what he wanted each instrument in the ensemble to do while another musician struggled to transcribe it.

He died of a brain hemorrhage at 43, but music he made nearly a century ago continues to show up in pop culture. Examples:

- The Matrix movie
- The Aviator movie
- [Mafia 1 video game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4DYfUSwDgI)
- [The Bioshock video games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vycdi-jGzv4)

> “Improv masters learn like babies: dive in and imitate and improvise first, learn the formal rules later. “At the beginning, your mom didn’t give you a book and say, ‘This is a noun, this is a pronoun, this is a dangling participle,’” Cecchini told me. “You acquired the sound first. And then you acquire the grammar later.”
