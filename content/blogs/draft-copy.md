## Reading News

What exactly is the news? this is the most basic definition:

Information on the events around the world.

- A missle launched from iran
- A 34 year old women stab her own mother
- there are thousand people in sudan dying because of hunger
- Trump says he has 'a group of very wealthy people' to buy TikTok

Sometimes the media mark some of these as "breaking news". that said, they mostly irrelevant to your personal world.

Here, i dont wanna write much about the benefits of the news. I think people mostly agree on these two things about its benifits:

1. it helps me stay informed! it gives me better context about the world, and because of that i can make better decision in my life.
2. It expands my knowledge in general. i hear and watch about many topics everyday. fast and easy.

Now let's think about its possible drawbacks:

## false sense of humanity

i have always feel it's my social responsibility to inform about the news. In every second when you are reading this blog post, there is some kind of atrocity and miserable event going on in the world and i need to just acknowledge that thing, even if i can't do anything for them.

I simply feel empathy.

The problem is quite obvious. Taking a interest by simply consuming news does not solve anything. **Genuine concern entails action.**

If you really care about the fate of victims of some bizzare event, donate your money to ones that are know what and where to do some practical help.

And you might say: So Just take an action! why you are pointing your finger at news?

The answer is: When we tune into news, we are constantly confronted with unresolved problems that are not solvable by us. This will overwhelm us. I Dont want to describe this as a truth, but personally when i consistently read news, i can not devote my energy enough to to be helpful on something that i can influence.

There is two main ways that you can be helpful:

- Practical Work (Crafting a solution).
- Donating your money

So yeah, ironically, i generally think it is better to less informed about the events about the world to do more. And be more helpful.

## News and Its effect on human cognition

I have been always interested in thinking about thinking(meta-cognition) . Subjects related to critical thinking and pseudo-science.

Now about the news. I think the most important problem that relates to this, is the fact that News inhibits thinking in general. The format of the News - Short headlines, quick review and summeries - often encourages shallow thinking. Specially in the current state of journalism.

## News is irrelevent

is this even need an explanation?

chances are you can not remember last time made a big decision in your life based of some news that you have read. if its even happened though.

## Wrapping up

After reading the book "Stop Reading The News", i'm quite convinced that i really don't want to follow up the news. by following up i mean deliberately having a daily feed sources like Television or Telegram channels.

In overall, i think if you need to know how the world work and what happend, there are better options. better forms of information. it can be Academic websites, Global gatherings and Books of course.
