If you truly love computers, don't let old habits hold you back.

For example: I grew up with Windows. It was familiar, convenient, and honestly, hard to leave. But over time, I realized that sticking with the same tools just because they were comfortable was limiting my understanding of the whole idea of computers.

Switching to Linux and getting familiar with Unix philosophy wasn’t easy at all. It took me about 3 month to feel comfortable in that and get some basic understanding to whole system. There were things I had to relearn, problems I had to solve, and moments of frustration. But that process—the struggle and the learning—is rewarding at the end.

If you want to understand computers better, you need to get comfortable to letting your old habits back. try new tools. New operating systems, new shells, new editors, and different workflows. Each one offers a different perspective. You don't have to abandon what works for you forever—but step out of your bubble now and then.

If you're into tech, curiosity should always outweigh comfort.
