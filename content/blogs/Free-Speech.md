If you think the concept of free **speech is often misunderstood, you are absolutely right.

The concept of free speech interpreted differently based on religious, political system and cultural contexts.

## Let's define Free-Speech

The idea of free speech is that, it is harder for governments to restrict certain forms of communication than it is for government to restrict other forms of physical actions.

in other words, It means **Communication** (like speaking, writing, protesting peacefully) is **more protected** than other kinds of behavior (like stealing, vandalizing, or physical violence).

Governments have **less power** to punish or control speech **than they do** to punish regular actions or conduct.

free speech as a legal right is *not originally American*, but the strongest and clearest modern form of it *did* come from the U.S. Constitution.

## Free Speech in the U.S. Context

## Is Free Speech Only Defined in the USA?

## So what is this wild misconception?

## Free-Speech in Iran

**free-speech in Iran is often granted. but it is limited** to protect:

- **Religious sanctity** (e.g., bans on blasphemy),
- **Political authority** (e.g., no criticism of the Supreme Leader),
- **Cultural values** (e.g., modesty, morality codes).
