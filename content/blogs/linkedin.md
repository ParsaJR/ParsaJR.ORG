## Linkedin

I've heard many suggestions about my career such as:

> At least you need a good Linkedin profile so people can know you. Its important for showcasing your skills. It's essential for a professional social network!

So one day, i give it a try and created new account. at first, i had no one to connect with so i just sent bunch of connection request to random people. i just thinking it's the right thing to do at the time.

the atmosphere of LinkedIn for a newcomer like me, feel weird. i note some of them in the headings down blow.

## Fake positivity, humbleness and appreciation

You often encounter people who want to connect with you and they seems really care about you even when you didn't had any meaningful relationship with them. I think the fact is, many users are just eager to expand their networks.

## Self-Congratulation

If you have a Linkedin account and are fairly active on it, go ahead and pull up your LinkedIn right now. Now scroll down. how many posts are about someone congratulating themselves?

I get a LOT of these. It seems like most of the posts are just someone sharing their latest achievement, whether it’s landing a new job, receiving an award, or completing a project.

I know, while it’s great to celebrate accomplishments, the frequency of these posts can feel nonsense and overwhelming. specially for the people who are don't have any job or significant project.

## The posts

The types of posts that appear on LinkedIn are strange. I mean, most of them are. there is even a dedicated subreddit for this [subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/).

For example:

1. A post about someone that explains their experience of divorcing with his wife.
2. A post about a person that sharing their bad experience of some famous food delivery service (Like snappfood in iran)
3. A post about highly controversial topics. For example, I've seen someone who is written a post on the subject : "why are there no female prophets in Islam?"

## Do i really need this thing?

Is LinkedIn vital to my success in my career?

I don't know. But i feel focusing on my skills are the right way **for now**.

i've watched a video about quitting Social Media and it is somehow relates to [this kind of objections](https://youtu.be/3E7hkPZ-HTk?si=xcdO0hexCNoZpj14\&t=281) for using social media.

The speaker in the video said something like this (in directly): "All that you need for landing a good job, Is a good amount of deep work. Cause everything in the market falls in place like that. People will find you. you don't need things like self-presentation like this. "

## Wrapping up

My experience with Linkedin was like a yet another social media (much like Facebook) + some social networking capabilities that are really fade out with such a contents... in several month that i was active on LinkedIn, the most rare activities are, the things that was related to work actually.
