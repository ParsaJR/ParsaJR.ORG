## Linkedin

i heard some suggestions like this endlessly about my Career:

> At least you need a good Linkedin profile so people can know you. Its important for showcasing your skills. It's essential for professional social network!

So one day, i give it a try and created new account. at first, i had no one to connect with so i just sent bunch of connection request to random people. i just thinking it's the right thing to do at the time.

the atmosphere of LinkedIn for a newcomer like me, feel weird. i note some of them in the headings down blow.

## Fake positivity, humbleness and appreciation

You often encounter people who want to connect with you and they seems really care about you even when you don't have any meaningful relationship with them.

## Self-Congratulation

If you have a Linkedin account and you are fairly active with it, go ahead and pull up your LinkedIn right now. Now scroll down. how many posts are about someone congratulating themselfs?

I get a LOT of these. It seems like most of the posts are just someone sharing their latest achievement, whether it’s landing a new job, receiving an award, or completing a project.

I know, while it’s great to celebrate accomplishments, the frequency of these posts can feel nonsense and overwhelming. specially for the people who are don't have any job or significant project.

## The posts

The types of posts that appear on LinkedIn are strange. I mean, most of them are. there is even a dedicated subreddit for this [subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/).

1. Seeing a post about someone that explains their experience of divorcing with his wife.
2. Seeing a post about a person that explain their bad experience of some famous food delivery service (Like snappfood in iran)
3.

## Wrapping up

Anyway i think Linkedin is yet another social media (much like Facebook) + some social networking capabilities that are really fade out with such a contents... in several month that i was active on LinkedIn, the most seldom activities are things related to work

if you are someone who doesn't use facebook or instagram but use LinkedIn regularly, you are probably in wrong spot.
