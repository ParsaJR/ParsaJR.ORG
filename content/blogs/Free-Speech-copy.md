## So what is this misconception?

psychologists have done lot of [research](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/motivated-reasoning) about something called **motivated reasoning**.

Motivated reasoning is a cognitive bias where people's reasoning and judgment are influenced by their motivations and desires. This means they are more likely to accept information and arguments that align with their existing beliefs and motivations, and they may be less receptive to information that contradicts them.

More specifically, motivated reasoning can be driven by a variety of motivations, many of them are emotional, social, or identity. Religion is actually one of the clearest areas where motivated reasoning shows up. Because religious beliefs often tie deeply into **identity, community, morality, and emotion**.

This kind of motivated reasoning is especially obvious in the Middle East, where religion, tradition, and national identity(collectivism) are present.

**Long story short, motivated reasoning is believing the world is the way you want to be.**

And because Free-Speech is such a counter intuitive idea, there is a good chance that people will engage in motivated reasoning.
